## Running a React app in a local development environment
- npm start - starts the development server
- npm run build - bundles the app into static files for deployment
- npm test - starts the test runner
- npm run eject - remove the create-react-app tool (copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!)
